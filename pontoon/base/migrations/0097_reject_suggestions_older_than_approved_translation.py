Reject all suggestions that are older than the approved translation.

Bug 1288956 added a `rejected` state to translations, and from then on, we consider
everything that is neither approved nor rejected to be a suggestion. In order
to reduce the amount of suggestions that will suddenly appear, we want to
mark most of them as rejected.

A translation will be rejected if:
  * it is not approved, and
  * it is older than either the submission date or the approval date
    of the approved translation for its entity.
