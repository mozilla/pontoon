# Pontoon Application Programming Interface

Pontoon provides access to some of its data through a set of public API endpoints, available in both REST and GraphQL formats.

# GraphQL API

Pontoon supports a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)-based endpoint, which is available at `/graphql/`.

The endpoint has two modes of operation: a JSON one and an HTML one.

## JSON mode

When a request is sent without any headers, with `Accept: application/json` or
if it explicitly contains a `raw` query argument, the endpoint will return JSON
`application/json` responses to GET and POST requests. In case of GET requests,
any whitespace in the query must be escaped.

An example GET request may look like this:

```bash
$ curl --globoff "https://example.com/graphql/?query={projects{name}}"
```

An example POST request may look like this:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -d "query={ projects { name } }" https://example.com/graphql/
```

## HTML mode

When a request is sent with `Accept: text/html` such as is the case when
accessing the endpoint in a browser, a GUI query editor and explorer,
[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), will be served::

    https://example.com/graphql/?query={projects{name}}

To preview the JSON response in the browser, pass in the `raw` query argument::

    https://example.com/graphql/?query={projects{name}}&raw

## Query IDE

The [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) query IDE is available at
`https://example.com/graphql/` when running Pontoon locally and the URL is
accessed with the `Accept: text/html` header, e.g. using a browser.

It offers a query editor with:

- syntax highlighting,
- field and arguments autocomplete,
- real-time error reporting,
- results folding,
- autogenerated docs on shapes and their fields,
- [introspection](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/debug/) via the `_debug`.

# REST API

Pontoon provides a set of [RESTful](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST) endpoints via the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), accessible under `/api/v2/`.

This endpoint only supports a JSON mode of operation and is best suited for retrieving data such as locales, projects, terminology, and translation memory.

## JSON Mode

When a request is sent without any headers or with `Accept: application/json`,
the endpoint will return JSON `application/json` responses to GET requests.

An example GET request may look like this:

```bash
$ curl --globoff "https://example.com/api/v2/search/terminology/?locale=ar"
```

## Browsable API

When accessed from a browser, Pontoon’s REST API provides a browsable, interactive HTML interface powered by Django REST Framework.

Available at any `/api/v2/` endpoint, the browsable API lets you:

- View and explore JSON data in a human-friendly format
- See validation rules and error messages inline
- Navigate related resources easily via hyperlinks

This interface is especially useful for exploring the API without external tools like Postman or curl.

## Pagination

All list-based endpoints are paginated. By default, each page contains up to 100 items.

Use the `?page=N` query parameter to navigate between pages.

An example may look like this:

```bash
$ curl --globoff "https://example.com/api/v2/locales/?page=2"
```
