Localizing your projects
========================

The following describes how to make your projects localizable with your Pontoon
instance.

Pontoon specializes in using version control systems as the source and store of
localizable strings. While internal Pontoon DB can be used for that purpose as
well, steps below assume you are using a `GitHub repository`_.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before you can set up a new project in Pontoon:

1. Ensure your project works with one of the `supported l10n frameworks`_.
2. Extract localizable strings into resource files.
3. Push resource files to your GitHub repository.
4. Make sure your Pontoon instance has write access to your repository.

   .. Note::

        The recommended way for that is to create a dedicated GitHub account,
        for your Pontoon instance, `add it as a collaborator`_ to your
        repository, and set ``SSH_KEY`` and ``SSH_CONFIG`` `as documented`_.

.. _GitHub repository: https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo
.. _supported l10n frameworks: ../index.html/
.. _add it as a collaborator: https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository
.. _as documented: ../admin/deployment.html/

Folder structure
----------------

To let Pontoon discover your localizable files, you'll either need to specify
paths in the `project config file`_ or strictly follow the file and folder
structure as expected by Pontoon:

1. Locale folders (including source locale) must be located at the same nesting
   level of the directory tree. You may want to put all locale folders into a
   dedicated ``locales`` folder.
2. Source locale needs to be called ``templates``, ``en-US``, ``en-us`` or
   ``en``. If multiple folders with such name exist in the repository and
   contain files in a supported file format, the first one will be used.
3. Locale code must not be part of the file name.

   Correct pattern::

       locales/{locale_code}/path/to/file.extension

   Incorrect pattern::

       locales/{locale_code}/path/to/file.{locale_code}.extension

Adding a new project to Pontoon
-------------------------------
When accessing your newly deployed app, your email address is your login in the
Sign In page and your password is the one picked during the setup phase. After
you log in, access Pontoon Admin (``/admin/``), click `ADD NEW PROJECT` and
fill out the following required fields:

1. **Name**: name of the project to be displayed in Pontoon dashboards.
2. **Slug**: used in URLs, will be generated automatically based on Name.
3. **Locales**: select at least one Localizable locale by clicking on it.
4. **Repository URL**: enter your repository's SSH URL of the form
   ``git@github.com:user/repo.git``.
5. **Download prefix**: used for manually downloading files. Select any
   localizable file on GitHub, click ``Raw`` and replace locale code and the
   following bits in the URL with {locale_code}.
6. Click **SAVE PROJECT** at the bottom of the page.
7. After the page reloads, click **SYNC** and wait for Pontoon to import
   strings. You can monitor the progrss in the Sync log (``/sync/log/``).

For complete documentation of the Admin form, please refer to Mozilla's
`new project documentation`_.

At this point you are ready to `start localizing your project`_ at
``/projects/SLUG/``!
