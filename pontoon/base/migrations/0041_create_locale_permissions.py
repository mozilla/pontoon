"""
Django's (version 1.8.4) executes post_migration hooked in django.contrib.auth after every migration.
This particular signal creates content_types and adds object's permissions to database.
However, next migrations will require ContentTypes and some of permissions that's
why we have to create them before post_migration is called. Important fact is there's currently no way
to remove ContentType and Permissions created in this migration because they will be recreated by Django.
That's why downgrade is a noop function.
