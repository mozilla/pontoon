- Feature Name: Guidelines for new contributors
- Created: 2022-05-31

# Summary

Provide new contributors with guidelines when making their first contribution.

# Motivation

It has been suggested on various occasions and from various sources, including at the localizer workshops, that the onboarding experience for new contributors needs improvements.

Pontoon homepage and tour lead users towards making their first contribution, but they don't get much guidance since that point nor are they connected with their team. Locale Managers also don't get any direct information when new contributors join their teams.

# Feature explanation

After the user makes her first suggestion in Pontoon, we send an in-app notification with the following goal:

- Welcome user to Pontoon.
- Clarify what will happen with the suggestion.
- Link to Pontoon docs.
- Explain how to get in touch with locale managers.
- If set, include links to team Info tab and locale style guide.

After the user makes her first suggestion in a particular locale, we send an in-app notification with just the locale-specific bits of the above defined message. We also send an in-app notification to locale managers, informing them about the new user.
