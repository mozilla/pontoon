<p>Thank you for taking on the responsibilities of a Team Manager for your locale. Your contributions have been instrumental for readers in your language. A Team Manager is pivotal to the health of their community, not only by acting as the organizing force and facilitator for internal community discussions, but also in the critical operational work of reviewing and providing timely feedback to contributors’ translation suggestions.</p>

<p>As part of our efforts to keep our localization community active and engaged, we periodically review account activity. We’ve noticed that in the past {{ settings.INACTIVE_MANAGER_PERIOD }} months you have not submitted any translations or reviewed any translation submissions for your locale. We understand that life can get busy, and finding time to contribute to projects isn't always easy. We get it.</p>

<p>One of the key <a href="https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/localizer-documentation/community/l10n_community_roles.html#locale-manager">expectations</a> for Team Managers is to ensure the timely feedback and review of suggestions to contributors and translators. In addition to ensuring users in your language receive a fully localized experience, timely review of submissions prevents discouragement among new and existing Pontoon contributors, fostering ongoing participation in our localization community.</p>

<p>Please take a moment to act by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Reviewing some outstanding translation submissions.</li>
    <li>Submitting translations for projects with missing translations.</li>
    <li>Responding to any outstanding feedback from your fellow team members.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, another Team Manager responsibility is to evaluate candidates for advanced roles within their community. Please review the <a href="{{ full_url('pontoon.teams.contributors', locale.code) }}">contributors page</a> for your team and see if there are any motivated and active community members that may be interested in taking on additional responsibilities within your team.</p>

<p>You can find more information on responsibilities and expectations for our localization community roles <a href="https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/localizer-documentation/community/l10n_community_roles.html#translator">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you again for your dedication. Together we can continue to make the internet open and accessible to all.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Pontoon Team</p>
