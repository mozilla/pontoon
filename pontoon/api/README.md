# GraphQL API

Pontoon exposes some of its data via a public API endpoint.

The API is [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)-based and available at ``/graphql``.  
The endpoint is exempt from CSP and CSRF validation so that is can be accessed
by third-party code with ease.


## Production Deployments

When run in production (``DEV is False``) the API returns ``application/json``
responses to GET and POST requests. In case of GET requests, any whitespace in
the query must be escaped.

An example GET requests may look like this:

```bash
$ curl --globoff https://example.com/graphql?query={projects{name}}
```

An example POST requests may look like this:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -d "query={ projects { name } }" https://example.com/graphql
```


## Local Development

In a local development setup (``DEV is True``) the endpoint has two modes of
operation: a JSON one and an HTML one.

When a request is sent, without any headers, with ``Accept: application/json`` or
if it explicitly contains a ``raw`` query argument, the endpoint will behave like
a production one, returning JSON responses.

The following query in the CLI will return a JSON response:

```bash
$ curl --globoff http://localhost:8000/graphql?query={projects{name}}
```

If however a request is sent with ``Accept: text/html`` such as is the case when
accessing the endpoint in a browser, a GUI query editor and explorer,
[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), will be served::

    http://localhost:8000/graphql?query={projects{name}}

To preview the JSON response in the browser, pass in the ``raw`` query argument::

    http://localhost:8000/graphql?query={projects{name}}&raw


## Query IDE

The [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) query IDE is available at
``http://localhost:8000/graphql`` when running Pontoon locally and the URL is
accessed with the ``Accept: text/html`` header, e.g. using a browser.

It offers a query editor with:

- syntax highlighting,
- field and arguments autocomplete,
- real-time error reporting,
- results folding,
- autogenerated docs on shapes and their fields,
- [introspection](http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/debug/) via the ``__debug``.
