<p>It's been a while since we’ve last seen you, but we wanted to thank you for contributing to localization efforts at <a href="{{ full_url('pontoon.homepage') }}">{{ full_url('pontoon.homepage') }}</a>.</p>

<p>Your contributions have been important for all readers in your language. We understand that life can get busy, and finding time to contribute to projects isn't always easy. We get it.</p>

<p>As part of our efforts to keep our localization community active and engaged, we periodically review account activity. We’ve noticed you haven’t signed in to your Pontoon account in the past {{ settings.INACTIVE_CONTRIBUTOR_PERIOD }} months. While we completely understand that circumstances change, we wanted to inform you that we may deactivate dormant accounts in the future to ensure the security and efficiency of our platform.</p>

<p>If you’d like to keep your Pontoon account active (we hope you will!) please sign in to Pontoon by visiting <a href="{{ full_url('pontoon.homepage') }}">{{ full_url('pontoon.homepage') }}</a> and click the “Sign in” button in the top right corner.</p>

<p>Regardless, we want to express our heartfelt thanks for your commitment to our mission and the positive impact you've made during your time here.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Pontoon Team</p>
