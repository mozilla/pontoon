Pontoon - Mozilla's Localization Platform
=========================================

Pontoon is a translation management system used and developed by the Mozilla
localization community. It can handle any project that uses one of the
supported file formats:

+-------+---------------+-------------+--------+-----------------------+
| .dtd  | .ftl (Fluent) | .inc        | .ini   | .json (WebExtensions) |
+-------+---------------+-------------+--------+-----------------------+
| .lang | .po (Gettext) | .properties | .xliff | .xml (Android)        |
+-------+---------------+-------------+--------+-----------------------+

Pontoon can pull strings it needs to translate from an external source, and write
them back periodically. Typically these external sources are version control
repositories that store the strings for an application. Supported external
sources include **Git**, **Mercurial** and **Subversion**.

Contributing
------------

If you are interested in contributing to Pontoon's code, start with
:doc:`dev/first-contribution`.

Deploying
---------

If you want to deploy your own instance of Pontoon, read the :doc:`admin/deployment`
section.

Once you have a running instance, you will likely want to learn about
:doc:`user/localizing-your-projects`, and then dive into
`management tasks <https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/documentation/tools/pontoon/>`_.

Localizing
----------

If you're looking for help on using Pontoon for localizing projects, whether on
Mozilla's instance or any other, you can read our
