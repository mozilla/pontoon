Source code
===========

Pontoon source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon>`_.


Issues
======

Our work is tracked in `GitHub <https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon/issues>`_.

`Report a new issue <https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon/issues/new>`_.


Docker
======

While the front-end (JavaScript) build and tests use the host environment for development,
the back-end systems (Python/Django, databases, etc.) run in Docker containers.
For production use, also the front-end is built in a container.
Thus Pontoon requires fewer things to get started
and you're guaranteed to have the same server setup as everyone else.

If you're not familiar with `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`_ and
`docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/>`_, it's worth
reading up on.

Writing to external repositories
--------------------------------

:doc:`Environment variables <../admin/deployment>` like ``SSH_KEY`` and ``SSH_CONFIG``
have no effect in a Docker setup.

The `~/.ssh` folder of the host system is mapped automatically to the home
folder within the container. In order to connect to a remote repository via SSH,
you need to create a passwordless SSH key, and configure `~/.ssh/config`
accordingly.

Here's an example for GitHub, assuming the private key file is called
`id_ed25519` (see also `GitHub's instructions
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>`_
to generate a new key):

.. code-block::

   Host github.com
      User YOUR_USERNAME
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
      StrictHostKeyChecking no

The project's repository will use the format
``git@github.com:{ORGANIZATION}/{REPOSITORY}.git`` for the ``URL`` field.

An alternative approach for GitHub is to use a `Personal Access Token (PAT)
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens>`_,
and set up the project's ``URL`` as `https://` instead of `git@`. In this case,
the ``URL`` will need to include both the PAT and username, e.g.
``https://{USER}:{TOKEN}@github.com/{REPOSITORY}``.


JavaScript setup
================

For working on the front-end, you need at least Node.js 14 and npm 7
(`installation instructions <https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm>`_).
Parts of the front-end use `npm workspaces <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces>`_,
which are not supported by earlier npm versions.


Database
========

By default, you will have default data loaded for only the Pontoon Intro project.
If you have a database dump, you can load it into your PostgreSQL database.

Make sure you backup your existing database first:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make dumpdb

And then load the dump:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make loaddb DB_DUMP_FILE=path/to/my/dump

Note that your database container needs to be running while you do that. You
can start just the postgresql container by running:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ docker-compose run postgresql -d


Interactive shell
=================

If you need to run specific commands, that are not covered by our `Makefile`,
you can start an interactive shell inside a Pontoon container:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make shell

`make shell-root` is also available to log in as `root`, instead of the
default `pontoon` user.

Browser Support
===============

The list of browsers supported by Pontoon is defined in the `"browserslist"` entry of the root package.json, and contains by default:

.. code-block:: bash

    Firefox >= 78
    Chrome >= 80
    Edge >= 91
    Safari >= 13.1


Code style
==========

We use code formatters so that we do not have to fight over code style.
You are free to write code however you like, because in the end the formatter is the one
that will format it. We thus don't need to pay attention to style during
code reviews, and are free from those never-ending code style discussions.

To format the Python and the JavaScript code at once you can use:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make format

Code formatting is explained in more detail in the following sections.

To run the required linters on the Python and the Javascript code at once you can use:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make lint


Python code conventions
=======================

Our Python code is automatically formatted using `ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_.
We enforce that in our Continuous Integration, so you will need to run
ruff on your code before sending it for review.

You can run ruff locally either as an
`add-on in your code editor <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/#vs-code-official>`_,
or as a `git pre-hook commit <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/#pre-commit>`_.
Alternatively, you can format your code using:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make ruff

In the rare case when you cannot fix an error, use ``# noqa`` to make the linter
ignore that error (see `documentation <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/#error-suppression>`_).
Note that in most cases, it is better to fix the issues than ignoring them.


Javascript code conventions
===========================

Our Javascript code is automatically formatted using `Prettier <https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html>`_.
We enforce that in our Continuous Integration, so you will need to run
prettier on your code before sending it for review.

You can run prettier locally either as an
`add-on in your code editor <https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html>`_,
or as a `git pre-hook commit <https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html>`_.
Alternatively, you can format your code using:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make prettier

Additionally, there are linting rules that are defined in our
``eslint.config.mjs`` file. To run the linter, do:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make eslint

In the rare case when you cannot fix an eslint error, use ``// eslint-disable`` to make the linter
ignore that error. Note that in most cases, it is better to fix the issues than ignore them.

For more specifics about the ``translate`` folder, look at the README.md file there.


Git conventions
===============

The first line is a summary of the commit. It should start with one of the following::

    Fix #1234

or::

    #1234


The first, when it lands, will cause the issue to be closed. The second one just adds
a cross-reference.

After that, the commit should explain *why* the changes are being made and any
notes that future readers should know for context or be aware of.

We follow `The seven rules of a great Git commit message <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules>`_:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how


Pull requests
=============

Pull request summary should indicate the issue the pull request addresses.

Pull request descriptions should cover at least some of the following:

1. what is the issue the pull request is addressing?
2. why does this pull request fix the issue?
3. how should a reviewer review the pull request?
4. what did you do to test the changes?
5. any steps-to-reproduce for the reviewer to use to test the changes


Code reviews
============

Pull requests should be reviewed before merging.

Style nits should be covered by linting as much as possible.

Code reviews should review the changes in the context of the rest of the system.


Python Dependencies
===================

Direct dependencies for Pontoon are distributed across four files:

1. ``requirements/default.in``: Running Pontoon in production
2. ``requirements/dev.in``: Development
3. ``requirements/test.in``: Testing
4. ``requirements/lint.in``:  Linting

In order to pin and hash the direct and indirect dependencies, we use
`uv pip compile <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#the-pip-interface>`_, which yields
corresponding ``*.txt`` files. These ``*.txt`` files contain all direct and
indirect dependencies, and can be used for installation with ``uv pip``. After any
change to the ``*.in`` files, you should run the following command to update all
``requirements/*.txt`` files.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make requirements

When adding a new requirement, add it to the appropriate ``requirements/*.in`` file.
For example, to add the development dependency ``foobar`` version 5, add ``foobar==5`` to ``requirements/dev.in``,
and then run the command from above.

Once you are done adding, removing or updating requirements, rebuild your docker environment:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make build-server

If there are problems, it'll tell you.

To upgrade existing dependencies within the given constraints of the input
files, you can pass options through to the ``uv pip compile`` invocations, i.e.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make requirements opts=--upgrade

Documentation
=============

Documentation for Pontoon is built with `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ and is available on ReadTheDocs.

Building docs is not covered with docker yet, so you will have to do it on your host. To make
a virtualenv to build docs, do this:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ cd docs/
    $ uv venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ uv pip install -r requirements/default.txt

Then, to build the docs, run this:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make html

The HTML documentation will be in `docs/_build/html/`. Try to open `docs/_build/html/index.html`
for example.

.. note:: Pontoon uses `GraphViz`_ as part of the documentation generation, so
   you'll need to install it to generate graphs that use it. Most package
   managers, including `Homebrew`_, have a package available for install.

.. _GraphViz: http://www.graphviz.org/
.. _Homebrew: http://brew.sh/


Running tests
=============

To run the entire test suite, do:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make test


To run only the ``translate`` tests:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make jest


To run only the Python tests:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make pytest


To run specific tests or specify arguments, you'll want to start a shell in the
test container:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make shell


Then you can run tests as you like.

Running all the unittests (make sure you run ``./manage.py collectstatic`` first):

.. code-block:: shell

    app@...:/app$ pytest


Running a directory of tests:

.. code-block:: shell

    app@...:/app$ pytest pontoon/base/


Running a file of tests:

.. code-block:: shell

    app@...:/app$ pytest pontoon/base/tests/test_views.py


Writing tests
=============

Put your tests in the ``tests/`` directory of the appropriate app in
``pontoon/``.


Mock usage
----------

`Mock <https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock.html>`_ is a python library for mocks
objects. This allows us to write isolated tests by simulating services besides
using the real ones. Best examples are existing tests which admittedly do mocking
different depending on the context.

Tip! Try to mock in limited context so that individual tests don't affect other
tests. Use context managers instead of monkey patching imported modules.


Updating Your Local Instance
============================

When changes are merged into the main Pontoon repository, you'll want to update
your local development instance to reflect the latest version of the site. You
can use Git as normal to pull the latest changes, but if the changes add any new
dependencies or alter the database, you'll want to install any new libraries and
run any new migrations.

If you're unsure what needs to be run, it's safe to just perform all of these
steps, as they don't affect your setup if nothing has changed:

.. code-block:: shell

   # Pull the latest code (assuming you've already checked out main).
   git pull origin main

   # Install new dependencies or update existing ones.
   uv pip install -U --force -r requirements/default.txt

   # Run database migrations.
   python manage.py migrate
