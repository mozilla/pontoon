        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The Levenshtein Python C extension module contains functions for fast
        computation of
        
        * Levenshtein (edit) distance, and edit operations
        
        * string similarity
        
        * approximate median strings, and generally string averaging
        
        * string sequence and set similarity
        
        It supports both normal and Unicode strings.
        
        Python 2.2 or newer is required; Python 3 is supported.
        
        StringMatcher.py is an example SequenceMatcher-like class built on the top of
        Levenshtein.  It misses some SequenceMatcher's functionality, and has some
        extra OTOH.
        
        Levenshtein.c can be used as a pure C library, too.  You only have to define
        NO_PYTHON preprocessor symbol (-DNO_PYTHON) when compiling it.  The
        functionality is similar to that of the Python extension.  No separate docs
        are provided yet, RTFS.  But they are not interchangeable:
        
        * C functions exported when compiling with -DNO_PYTHON (see Levenshtein.h)
          are not exported when compiling as a Python extension (and vice versa)
        
        * Unicode character type used with -DNO_PYTHON is wchar_t, Python extension
          uses Py_UNICODE, they may be the same but don't count on it
        
        Documentation
        --------------
        
        gendoc.sh generates HTML API documentation,
        you probably want a selfcontained instead of includable version, so run
        in ``./gendoc.sh --selfcontained``.  It needs Levenshtein already installed
        and genextdoc.py.

        History
        -------
        
        This package was long missing from PyPi and available as source checkout only.
        We needed to restore this package for `Go Mobile for Plone <http://webandmobile.mfabrik.com>`_
        and `Pywurfl <http://celljam.net/>`_ projects which depend on this.

        ============
         Changelog
        ============
        
        0.11.2
        ------
        
        * Fixed a bug in setup.py: installation would fail on Python 3 if the locale
          did not specify UTF-8 charset (Felix Yan).
        
        * Added COPYING, StringMatcher.py, gendoc.sh and NEWS in MANIFEST.in, as they
          were missing from source distributions.
        
        0.11.1
        ------
        
        * Added Levenshtein.h to MANIFEST.in
        
        0.11.0
        ------
        
        * Python 3 support, maintainership passed to Antti Haapala
        
        0.10.1 - 0.10.2
        ---------------
        
        * Made python-Lehvenstein Git compatible and use setuptools for PyPi upload
        
        * Created HISTORY.txt and made README reST compatible
