<p>Thank you again for joining translation community on Pontoon. As always, you can continue contributing translations at <a href="{{ full_url('pontoon.homepage') }}">{{ full_url('pontoon.homepage') }}</a>.</p>

<p>Following up on our welcome email, which had some quick tips to help get you started, we’d like to provide a brief introduction to how localization works in Pontoon.</p>

<h2>Translation phases</h2>

<p>Translation goes through roughly four phases:</p>

<ol>
    <li>New source strings added: When new strings (individual pieces of text or content that need to be translated) are added, they appear in Pontoon as “Missing”.</li>
    <li>Translation suggestion submitted: When a contributor like you submits a translation suggestion, the status of the translation is set to “Unreviewed”. This alerts translators and team managers (see below) that translations are ready for their review.</li>
    <li>Translation review: After a string is reviewed, it will either be approved and appear in Pontoon as “Translated” or receive feedback — possibly in the form of a comment. After outstanding feedback is addressed the strings will be approved.</li>
    <li>Translated: Once the new strings are translated, they are ready to be included into the product. The timing depends on the project, but often strings will be implemented at the time of the next build and ready to check in product. Be sure to check the deadlines in the <a href="{{ full_url('pontoon.projects') }}">project page</a> to understand which strings need translations soon.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each localization community has its own specific workflows, so do reach out to your <a href="{{ full_url('pontoon.teams') }}">Team Managers</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2>Team roles</h2>

<p>Speaking of team managers, teams can have up to 3 different roles. While all roles contribute translations for their language, some roles have additional responsibilities:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Team Manager: Team managers are responsible for managing and growing their language community, including: mentoring new contributors, providing feedback on their translation submissions, and creating language resources. Each locale will have at least one team manager.</li>
    <li>Translator: Translators are responsible for reviewing translation submissions and providing feedback to team contributors. Community members that have been evaluated by the team manager and other translators can be assigned the translator role.</li>
    <li>Contributor: Contributors submit translation suggestions in Pontoon for their target language. New members of a language community start as a contributor.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve found that the best way for new contributors to learn and grow within their community is to network with other team members and proactively request feedback from translators and managers on their submissions. If you have trouble reaching other team members or getting feedback, let us or the project manager know (see below).</p>

<h2>Project manager</h2>

<p>Finally, there is one key point of contact to support you in your translation journey — the project manager. Each project on Pontoon has a project manager assigned to act as the primary point of contact for the project itself. They are there to answer your questions and assist with any problems you are having related to translation of project strings.</p>

<p>If you have a question or issue related to a particular string, you can click the “REQUEST CONTEXT or REPORT ISSUE” button from the translation view in Pontoon. That will create a comment you can fill in with the details and it will notify the project manager. You can also find the project manager’s contact information in their profile by clicking on their name in the field at the top of the project page.</p>

<p>We hope this gives you a better understanding of how localization works in Pontoon.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Pontoon Team</p>
