<p>
  Thank you for taking on the responsibilities of a Team Manager for your
  locale. Your contributions have been instrumental for readers in your
  language. A Team Manager is pivotal to the health of their community, not only
  by acting as the organizing force and facilitator for internal community
  discussions, but also in the critical operational work of reviewing and
  providing timely feedback to contributors’ translation suggestions.
</p>

<p>
  As part of our efforts to keep our localization community active and engaged,
  we periodically review account activity. We’ve noticed that in the past
  {{ settings.INACTIVE_MANAGER_PERIOD }} months you have not submitted any
  translations or reviewed any translation submissions for your locale. We
  understand that life can get busy, and finding time to contribute to projects
  isn't always easy. We get it.
</p>

<p>
  One of the key

    >expectations</a
  >
  for Team Managers is to ensure the timely feedback and review of suggestions
  to contributors and translators. In addition to ensuring users in your
  language receive a fully localized experience, timely review of submissions
  prevents discouragement among new and existing Pontoon contributors, fostering
  ongoing participation in our localization community.
</p>

<p>Please take a moment to act by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reviewing some outstanding translation submissions.</li>
  <li>Submitting translations for projects with missing translations.</li>
  <li>Responding to any outstanding feedback from your fellow team members.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition, another Team Manager responsibility is to evaluate candidates for
  advanced roles within their community. Please review the
  <a href="{{ full_url('pontoon.teams.contributors', locale.code) }}"
    >contributors page</a
  >
  for your team and see if there are any motivated and active community members
  that may be interested in taking on additional responsibilities within your
  team.
