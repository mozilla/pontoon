Translate Toolkit 1.10.0
************************

*Released on 12 March 2013*

This release contains many improvements and bug fixes. While it contains many
general improvements, it also specifically contains needed changes for the
upcoming `Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org/>`_ 2.5.0.

It is just over a year since the last release so there are many improvements
across the board.  A number of people contributed to this release and we've
tried to credit them wherever possible (sorry if somehow we missed you).

* Documentation - migrated all from our wiki into the code and Read The Docs
* Continuous Integration using Travis


Most important for Pootle
-------------------------
* Version control improvements
* Categorize pofilter checks into critical, functional, cosmetic, etc


Formats and Converters
----------------------
* Android format support [Michal Čihař]
* Mozilla .lang, many improvements
* PHP support for defintions, // comments and improved whitespace preservation
* PO: X-Merge-On header to explicitly demand a conversion strategy instead of
  guessing
* .properties: BOMs in messages and C style comments [Roman Imankulov]
* Mac OS String formatting improved [Roman Imankulov]
* The spaces in DTD files are now preserved. For example the spaces in
  ``<!ENTITY          some.label          "definition">`` around the entity
  name ``some.label`` are now kept.
* The matching criterion when merging units can now be specified with the
  ``X-Merge-On`` header. Available values for this header are `location` and
  `id`. By default merges will be done by matching IDs. This supersedes the
  effects of the ``X-Accelerator`` header when merging and establishes an
  explicit way to set the desired matching criterion.


Version Control improvements
----------------------------
* Interface for adding files to a repository & Implement .add() for all VCSs.
* Caching of VC version info
* Don't look for VCS if it's not available
* Stop looking for VCS at a given parent
* Subversion VC tests
* Alway pass -m to 'commit' in Subversion to prevent blocking


Checks
------
* New OpenOffice variables style used in extensions
* Check for self-closing tags in the xmltags test [Seb M].
* GConf test fixes
* Terminology checker type for future terminology features
* Categorize pofilter checks into critical, functional, cosmetic, etc

* Punctuation rules and tests to ignore for: Burmese, Urdu, Afrikaans, Wolof


Documentation
-------------
* Moved to Git and we are now using reStructured Text and Sphinx
* Published in Read The Docs (RTD).
* Old wiki migrated to RTD.
* New clean theme for documentation and website
