Translate Toolkit 1.11.0-rc1
****************************

*Released on 28 November 2013*

This release contains many improvements and bug fixes. While it contains many
general improvements, it also specifically contains needed changes and
optimizations for the upcoming `Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org/>`_
2.5.1 and `Virtaal <http://virtaal.translatehouse.org>`_ releases.

It is just over a eight months since the last release and there are many
improvements across the board.  A number of people contributed to this release
and we've tried to credit them wherever possible (sorry if somehow we missed
you).

Highlighted improvements
========================

Major changes
-------------

- PHP format adds a number of new features
- Support for Python 2.5 has been dropped

Formats and Converters
----------------------
- Gettext PO:

  - cPO now handles fuzzy obsolete messages correctly
  - Line wrapping improvement allow PO files to more closely match Gettext
  - Optimization to increase performance

- PHP:

  - Warn about duplicate entries
  - Allow blank spaces in array declaration (:issue:`2646`)
  - Support nested arrays (:issue:`2240`)

- XLIFF:

  - Correctly parse XLIFF 1.2

- Properties
  
  - Blank source text is now always translated
  - Fuzzy units are discarded with --remove-untranslated
  - prop2po no longer drops entries that are translated the same as the source

- TMX:

  - po2tmx support comments

- Android:

  - Detect untranslatable resource strings
  - Various format improvements

- New conversion options:

  - :option:`--timestamp` -- skip conversion if the output file has a newer
    timestamp (Makefile-alike)
  - :option:`--threshold` -- in po2* converters this allows you to specify a
    percentage complete threshold.  If the PO files passes this theshold then
    the file is output (:issue:`2998`)
  - :option:`--removeuntranslated` -- Extend this option to po2dtd and thus
    po2moz -- don't output untranslated text (:issue:`1718`)

Language specific fixes
-----------------------
- The toolkit now supports: Sakha, N'ko, Turkish, improvements for Bengali &
  Hindi
- Pootle special characters are now stored on Toolkit and available for other
  tools to use
- Rules for language ``ab`` are now available for language ``ab_CD``

- Reduce false positive for the filepath test in cases of self closing tags
  e.g. ``<br />``

- .lang -- Improved support for untranslated entries
- ``buildxpi``:

  - Can now build multiple languages at once (:issue:`2999`)
  - Set a max product version to allow the language pack to continue to work
    once the browser version has moved out of Aurora channel

- Dropped native XPI building support (untested and no longer used)
- Add Mozilla plural formulas, in time we'll handle Mozilla plurals correctly

General
-------
- Dropped support for Python 2.5 -- 2.5 has reached end-of-life
- Dropped psyco support -- it is no longer maintained
- Use logging throught instead of ``sys.stderr``
- Lots of cleanups on docs: TBX, PHP, added Android and JSON docs
- Use requirements files for documenting all requirements and make it easy to
  install Translate Toolkit using ``pip``
- Added some functional tests
- Improve searching to find words with hyphens
- Choose the closest repo in nested VCS
- Test suite down to zero failing tests

...and loads of internal changes to improve maintainability, remove unused
imports, remove unused code and general code cleanups, some changes to ensure
future Python 3 portability and of course many many bugfixes.
