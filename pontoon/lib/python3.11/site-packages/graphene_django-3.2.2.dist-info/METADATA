Graphene-Django is an open-source library that provides seamless integration between Django, a high-level Python web framework, and Graphene, a library for building GraphQL APIs. The library allows developers to create GraphQL APIs in Django quickly and efficiently while maintaining a high level of performance.

## Features

* Seamless integration with Django models
* Automatic generation of GraphQL schema
* Integration with Django's authentication and permission system
* Easy querying and filtering of data
* Support for Django's pagination system
* Compatible with Django's form and validation system
* Extensive documentation and community support

## Installation

To install Graphene-Django, run the following command:

```sh
pip install graphene-django
```

## Configuration

After installation, add 'graphene_django' to your Django project's `INSTALLED_APPS` list and define the GraphQL schema in your project's settings:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'graphene_django',
]

GRAPHENE = {
    'SCHEMA': 'myapp.schema.schema'
}
```

## Usage

To use Graphene-Django, create a `schema.py` file in your Django app directory and define your GraphQL types and queries:

```python
import graphene
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType
from .models import MyModel

class MyModelType(DjangoObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = MyModel

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    mymodels = graphene.List(MyModelType)

    def resolve_mymodels(self, info, **kwargs):
        return MyModel.objects.all()

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
```

Then, expose the GraphQL API in your Django project's `urls.py` file:

```python
from django.urls import path
from graphene_django.views import GraphQLView
from . import schema

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path('graphql/', GraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True)), # Given that schema path is defined in GRAPHENE['SCHEMA'] in your settings.py
]
```

## Testing

Graphene-Django provides support for testing GraphQL APIs using Django's test client. To create tests, create a `tests.py` file in your Django app directory and write your test cases:

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from graphene_django.utils.testing import GraphQLTestCase
from . import schema

class MyModelAPITestCase(GraphQLTestCase):
    GRAPHENE_SCHEMA = schema.schema

    def test_query_all_mymodels(self):
        response = self.query(
            '''
            query {
                mymodels {
                    id
                    name
                }
            }
            '''
        )

        self.assertResponseNoErrors(response)
        self.assertEqual(len(response.data['mymodels']), MyModel.objects.count())
```
