Developer Setup
===============

The following describes how to set up an instance of the site on your
computer for development with Docker and docker-compose.

   .. Warning::

    These installation steps are made for development only. It is not
    recommended to run Pontoon via Docker in production.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_.

2. Install `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_. You need
   1.10 or higher.

3. Install `make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ using either your
   system's package manager (Linux) or Xcode command line developer tools (OSX).
   On Windows, you can use `MozillaBuild <https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaBuild>`_.

Quickstart
----------

1. Clone your `fork <https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>`_ of Pontoon repository::

     $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pontoon.git


2. From the root of the repository, run::

     $ make build

   That will build the containers required for development: base and
   webapp.

   .. Note::

        If you want to share your development instance in your local network,
        set SITE_URL to bind the webapp to any address you like, e.g.
        ``make build SITE_URL="http://192.168.1.14:8000"``.


3. Run the webapp::

      $ make run

   .. Note::

        The first time you run this, the PostgreSQL container needs to do
        some work before it becomes available to the webapp container. Hence,
        the webapp might not be able to perform things like migrations.
        You can simply wait for the postgresql container to report that it's
        ready, then abort the process, then restart it. That should let the
        webapp do all its setup as expected.

        Alternatively, you can run ``docker-compose up postgresql`` and wait
        until it reports that the database is ready, then stop that and run
        ``make run``.


4. Finally, you need to run some setup steps, while the webapp is running::

      $ make setup

   This will ask you to create a superuser, and then will update your Firefox
   account settings.

The app should now be available at http://localhost:8000 or the custom SITE_URL.

   .. Warning::

        After you execute ``make run``, the console output might trick you into
        accessing Pontoon in the browser at http://localhost:3000/. Note that
        the URL only refers to the frontend app, which is not meant to be used
        standalone.

        To access Pontoon app, you should use http://localhost:8000 or the
        custom SITE_URL.

And with that, you're ready to start :doc:`contributing`!


Installing Docker on Windows Pro/Enterprise/Education
-----------------------------------------------------

Install `Docker Desktop for Windows <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>`_.

Install tools (git, make, cygwin)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The easiest way is to use a package manager like
`Chocolatey <https://chocolatey.org/install>`_. Follow the installation
instructions for Windows Powershell (Admin), then run
``choco install make git cygwin`` to install all packages.

Follow the prompt requests allowing script execution. At the end, verify that
packages are available with ``make --version`` and ``git --version``, it should
return a version for each command.

At this point you need to disable the config ``core.autocrlf`` before cloning
the Pontoon repository, otherwise all files will use Windows line-endings
(CRLF), and docker images will fail to build. To do so, open a Powershell as
Admin (right click on the Start Menu, select *Windows Powershell (Admin)*), and
run::

   git config --system --unset core.autocrlf
   git config --global core.autocrlf false

You can use ``git config -l`` to verify that the value for ``core.autocrlf`` is
correctly set.

At this point, you can open the *Cygwin64 Terminal* and proceed with the
installation (the content of ``C:`` will be available in ``/cygdrive/c``). Once
the Docker image is running, Pontoon's instance will be available at
`http://localhost:8000`.


Installing Docker on Windows Home x64 (deprecated)
--------------------------------------------------

These instructions rely on the installation of a deprecated tool called `Docker
Toolbox <https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/>`_, since the
official installer (Docker Desktop for Windows) is only compatible with Windows
Pro, Enterprise, or Education.

Once installed, it will create a *Docker Quickstart Terminal* icon on the
Desktop that can be used to start a terminal.

While ``git`` is installed as part of Docker Toolbox, you need to disable the
config ``core.autocrlf`` before cloning the Pontoon repository, otherwise all
files will use Windows line-endings (CRLF), and docker images will fail to
build. To do so, open a Powershell as Admin (right click on the Start Menu,
select *Windows Powershell (Admin)*), and run::

   git config --system --unset core.autocrlf
   git config --global core.autocrlf false

Install make
++++++++++++

The easiest way is to use a package manager like `Chocolatey
<https://chocolatey.org/install>`_. Follow the installation instructions for
Windows Powershell (Admin), then run ``choco install make`` to install
``make``.

Follow the prompt requests allowing script execution. At the end, verify that
make is available with ``make --version``, it should return a version (e.g. GNU
Make 4.2.1)

Repository Path and SITE_URL
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Make sure to clone the repository in a path where the user has write
permissions. The procedure has been tested with the clone inside the user's
home (``c:\Users\username``). Otherwise, the image might fail to load the
correct volumes.

Since Pontoon will be running inside a VirtualBox machine, in order to access
Pontoon the Docker image needs to be build with a ``SITE_URL`` using the IP of
the machine.

The IP of the virtual machine is displayed when starting *Docker Quickstart
Terminal*, or can be retrieved using the command `docker-machine ip default`.
For example, if the IP is ``192.168.99.100``, the Docker image should be built
with ``make build SITE_URL="http://192.168.99.100:8000"``. Pontoon's instance
will be then available at ``http://192.168.99.100:8000`` from Windows.
