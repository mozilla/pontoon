# This requirements file should only contain direct dependencies of our project.
#
# The dependencies are grouped by function:
# default.in: required for running a pontoon instance
# dev.in: required for development
# test.in: required for running tests
# lint.in: required for linting
#
# All requirements/*.in files are compiled to requirements/*.txt files with pip-compile.
# This step is only required when adding, removing or updating dependencies,
# or to force an update of indirect dependencies.
# Run 'make requirements' for compiling these files.
#
# The dependencies are sorted by alphabetical order.
# Dependencies that do not come from pypi (eg. eggs from github) are listed at the end of the list.
