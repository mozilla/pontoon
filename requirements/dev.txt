# This requirements file is formatted to make it easy to see what are the
# direct requirements of our application, and what are dependencies of
# those requirements.
#
# The intent is to make this big mess of a file more maintainable. When removing
# a dependency, it should be easy to see exactly what else can be removed. This
# way we avoid keeping things in here that we don't require anymore.
#
# When adding a new requirement, it should fall in one of two categories:
#
# 1. Top-level requirements with no dependencies.
# 2. Top-level requirement, followed by its dependencies.
#
# The first group is straight-forward: all top-level dependencies (resources that
# are used by the application directly) are sorted by alphabetical order.
# Dependencies that do not come from pypi (eg. eggs from github) are listed at
# the end of that list.
#
# The second group are should be added to requirements-constraints.txt and follow conventions
# explained there.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# requirements/default.txt contains all dependencies required to run python in the production environment.
