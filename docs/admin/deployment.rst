Deployment
==========

Pontoon is designed to be deployed on Heroku. To deploy an instance of Pontoon
on Heroku, you must first create an app on your Heroku dashboard. The steps
below assume you've already created an app and have installed the
`Heroku Toolbelt`_.

For quick and easy deployment without leaving your web browser, click this button:

   :target: https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon/tree/master

.. _Heroku Toolbelt: https://toolbelt.heroku.com/

Buildpack
---------
Pontoon uses several buildpacks in a specific order. They are (in order):

1. `heroku-buildpack-apt`_ for installing Subversion.
2. `heroku-buildpack-ssh`_ for setting up the SSH keys necessary for committing
   to version control.
3. The official ``heroku/nodejs`` buildpack for installing Node.js programs for
   pre-processing frontend assets.
4. The official ``heroku/python`` buildpack as our primary buildpack.

You can set these buildpacks on your app with the following toolbelt commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Note that we use add and --index 1 to append to the top of the list.
   heroku buildpacks:set heroku/python
   heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs
   heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/Osmose/heroku-buildpack-ssh.git#v0.1
   heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/mozilla/heroku-buildpack-apt.git#v0.1

.. _heroku-buildpack-apt: https://github.com/mozilla/heroku-buildpack-apt
.. _heroku-buildpack-ssh: https://github.com/Osmose/heroku-buildpack-ssh

Environment Variables
---------------------
The following is a list of environment variables you'll want to set on the app
you create:

``ADMIN_EMAIL``
   Optional. Email address for the ``ADMINS`` setting.

``ADMIN_NAME``
   Optional. Name for the ``ADMINS`` setting.

``CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER``
   Controls whether asynchronous tasks (mainly used during sync) are sent to
   Celery or executed immediately and synchronously. Set this to ``False`` on
   production.

``CELERYD_MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD``
   Maximum number of tasks a Celery worker process can execute before itâ€™s
   replaced with a new one. Defaults to 20 tasks.

``DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC``
   Disables running ``./manage.py collectstatic`` during the build. Should be
   set to ``1``.

   Heroku's Python buildpack has a bug that causes issues when running node
   binaries during the compile step of the buildpack. To get around this, we run
   the command in our post-compile step (see ``bin/post_compile``) when the
   issue doesn't occur.

``DJANGO_DEBUG``
   Controls ``DEBUG`` mode for the site. Should be set to `False` in
   production.

``DJANGO_DEV``
   Signifies whether this is a development server or not. Should be `False` in
   production.
   Adds some additional django apps that can be helpful during day to day development.

``ERROR_PAGE_URL``
   Optional. URL to the page displayed to your users when the application encounters
   a system error. See `Heroku Reference`_ for more information.

``MAINTENANCE_PAGE_URL``
   Optional. URL to the page displayed to your users when the application is placed
   in the maintenance state. See `Heroku Reference`_ for more information.

``NEW_RELIC_API_KEY``
   Optional. API key for accessing the New Relic REST API. Used to mark deploys
   on New Relic.

``NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME``
   Optional. Name to give to this app on New Relic. Required if you're using
   New Relic.

``PROJECT_MANAGERS``
   Optional. A list of project manager email addresses to send project requests to

``SECRET_KEY``
   Required. Secret key used for sessions, cryptographic signing, etc.

``SITE_URL``
   Controls the base URL for the site, including the protocol and port.
   Defaults to ``http://localhost:8000``, should always be set in production.

``SSH_CONFIG``
   Contents of the ``~/.ssh/config`` file used when Pontoon connects to VCS
   servers via SSH. Used for disabling strict key checking and setting the
   default user for SSH. For example::

      StrictHostKeyChecking=no

      Host hg.mozilla.org
      User pontoon@mozilla.com

      Host svn.mozilla.org
      User pontoon@mozilla.com

``SSH_KEY``
   SSH private key to use for authentication when Pontoon connects to VCS
   servers via SSH.

``STATIC_HOST``
   Optional. Hostname to prepend to static resources paths. Useful for serving
   static files from a CDN. Example: ``//asdf.cloudfront.net``.

``SVN_LD_LIBRARY_PATH``
   Path to prepend to ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` when running SVN. This is necessary
   on Heroku because the Python buildpack alters the path in a way that breaks
   the built-in SVN command. Set this to ``/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/``.

.. note:: Some environment variables, such as the SSH-related ones, may contain
   newlines. The easiest way to set these is using the ``heroku`` command-line
   tool to pass the contents of an existing file to them:

   .. code-block:: bash

      heroku config:set SSH_KEY="`cat /path/to/key_rsa`"

.. _Heroku Reference: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-pages#customize-pages

``TZ``
   Timezone for the dynos that will run the app. Pontoon operates in UTC, so set
   this to ``UTC``.

Provisioning Workers
--------------------
Pontoon executes asynchronous jobs using `Celery`_. These jobs are handled by
the ``worker`` process type. You'll need to manually provision workers based on
how many projects you plan to support and how complex they are. At a minimum,
you'll want to provision at least one ``worker`` dyno:

.. code-block:: bash

   heroku ps:scale worker=1

.. _Celery: http://www.celeryproject.org/

Add-ons
-------
Pontoon is designed to run with the following add-ons enabled:

- Database: Heroku Postgres
- Performance Monitoring: New Relic APM
- Log Management: Papertrail
- Error Tracking: Raygun.io
- Email: Sendgrid
- Scheduled Jobs: Heroku Scheduler
- Cache: Memcachier
- RabbitMQ: CloudAMQP

It's possible to run with the free tiers of all of these add-ons, but it is
recommended that, at a minimum, you run the "Standard 0" tier of Postgres.

Cache Add-ons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pontoon uses `django-bmemcached`_, which expects the following environment
variables from the cache add-on:

``MEMCACHE_SERVERS``
   Semi-colon separated list of memcache server addresses.
``MEMCACHE_USERNAME``
   Username to use for authentication.
``MEMCACHE_PASSWORD``
   Password to use for authentication.

.. note::

   By default, the environment variables added by Memcachier are prefixed
   with ``MEMCACHIER`` instead of ``MEMCACHE``. You can "attach" the
   configuration variables with the correct prefix using the ``addons:attach``
   command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      heroku addons:attach resource_name --as MEMCACHE

   Replace ``resource_name`` with the name of the resource provided by the cache
   addon you wish to use, such as ``memcachier:100``. Use the
   ``heroku addons`` command to see a list of resource names that are available.

.. _django-bmemcached:: https://github.com/jaysonsantos/python-binary-memcached

RabbitMQ Add-ons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Similar to the cache add-ons, Pontoon expects environment variables from the
RabbitMQ add-on:

``RABBITMQ_URL``
   URL for connecting to the RabbitMQ server. This should be in the format for
   Celery's `BROKER_URL`_ setting.

.. note::

   Again, you must attach the resource for RabbitMQ as ``RABBITMQ``. See the
   note in the Cache Add-ons section for details.

.. _BROKER_URL: http://celery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#broker-url

Scheduled Jobs
--------------
Pontoon requires a single scheduled job that runs the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./manage.py sync_projects

It's recommended to run this job once an hour. It commits any string changes in
the database to the remote VCS servers associated with each project, and pulls
down the latest changes to keep the database in sync.

Sync Log Retention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may also optionally run the ``clear_old_sync_logs`` management command on a
schedule to remove sync logs from the database that are over 90 days old:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./manage.py clear_old_sync_logs

Database Migrations
-------------------
After deploying Pontoon for the first time, you must run the database
migrations. This can be done via the toolbelt:

.. code-block:: bash

   heroku run ./manage.py migrate

Creating an Admin User
----------------------
After deploying the site, you can create a superuser account using the
``createsuperuser`` management command:

.. code-block:: bash

   heroku run ./manage.py createsuperuser --noinput --user=admin --email=your@email.com

If you've already logged into the site with the email that you want to use,
you'll have to use the Django shell to mark your user account as an admin:

.. code-block:: bash

   heroku run ./manage.py shell
   # Connection and Python info...
   >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
   >>> user = User.objects.get(email='your@email.com')
   >>> user.is_staff = True
   >>> user.is_superuser = True
   >>> user.save()
   >>> exit()

Gotchas
-------
- Changing the ``SSH_KEY`` or ``SSH_CONFIG`` environment variables *requires*
  a rebuild of the site, as these settings are only used at build time. Simply
  changing them will not actually update the site until the next build.

  The `Heroku Repo`_ plugin includes a rebuild command that is handy for
  triggering builds without making code changes.

.. _Heroku Repo: https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo

And so you're ready to start :doc:`../user/localizing-your-projects`!
