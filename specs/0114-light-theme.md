- Feature Name: Light theme
- Created: 2023-06-22

# Summary

Implement light theme and enable users to switch between the (current) dark theme and the light theme.

# Motivation

Over the years, many users have expressed preference for a light color theme over the Pontoon default dark theme. Having the ability to switch themes will also allow us to implement high contrast themes, which benefit low vision users, increase readability and reduce websiteâ€™s visual noise.

# Feature explanation

Users are able to switch between `Dark theme`, `Light theme` and `Match system` in Settings and the Profile menu. Each theme is represented with a title and a radio box. As soon as the theme is selected, it gets applied and the setting get saved. The default setting is the `Dark theme`.

The `Match system` setting lets the browser pick the theme from the OS setting using the [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) CSS media feature.

# Implementation notes

In the first step, we'll replace existing hardcoded color values with CSS variables. We'll store those in separate CSS files, with one version of each file for each theme.

# Main color pairs

The following is a non-exhaustive list of color transformations between the dark and the light theme:

* Main background color: #3f4752 -> #fbfbfb
* Highlighted area background color: #333941 -> #eee
