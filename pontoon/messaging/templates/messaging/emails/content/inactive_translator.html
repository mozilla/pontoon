<p>Thank you for taking on the responsibilities of a Translator for your locale. Your contributions have been instrumental for readers in your language. Translators play a critical role in ensuring the health of their community by reviewing and providing timely feedback to contributors’ translation suggestions.</p>

<p>As part of our efforts to keep our localization community active and engaged, we periodically review account activity. We’ve noticed that in the past {{ settings.INACTIVE_TRANSLATOR_PERIOD }} months you have not submitted any translations or reviewed any translation submissions for your locale. We understand that life can get busy, and finding time to contribute to projects isn't always easy. We get it.</p>

<p>One of the key <a href="https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/localizer-documentation/community/l10n_community_roles.html#translator">expectations</a> for Translators is to ensure the timely review of suggestions and to contribute translations for new source language content. In addition to ensuring users in your language receive a fully localized experience, timely review of submissions prevents discouragement among new and existing Pontoon contributors, fostering ongoing participation in our localization community.</p>

<p>Please take a moment to act by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Reviewing some outstanding translation submissions.</li>
    <li>Submitting translations for projects with missing translations.</li>
    <li>Responding to any outstanding feedback from your fellow team members.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you again for your dedication. Together we can continue to make the internet open and accessible to all.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Pontoon Team</p>
