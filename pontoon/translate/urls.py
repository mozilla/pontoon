# For local development, we want to serve front-end static files from the
# webserver that create-react-app is running. This way we benefit from
# hot reloading and all the niceties of React dev tools.
# To do that, we must overwrite the staticfiles serve view, and we also
# want to catch websocket connexions.
#
# Note that because we override the static files serving, you will need to
# run your local django server with the `--nostatic` option. That's
# automatically done when running with `make run`.
