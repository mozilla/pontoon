async
=====
Async aims to make writing asyncronous processing easier. It provides a task-graph 
with interdependent tasks that communicate using blocking channels, allowing 
to delay actual computations until items are requested.
Tasks will automatically be distributed among 0 or more threads for the actual computation.

Even though the GIL effectively prevents true concurrency, operations which block, 
such as file IO, can be sped up with it already. In conjuction with 
custom c extensions which release the GIL, true concurrency can be obtained as well.
